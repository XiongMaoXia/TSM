# Repository Contents

A full list of the TSM methods contained in this repository can be found [here](https://zygurt.github.io/TSM/methods).

Additional information about the [Time-Scale Modification Dataset with Subjective Labels](https://zygurt.github.io/TSM/subjective).

Additional information about the [Objective Measure of Quality for Time-Scale Modification](https://zygurt.github.io/TSM/objective).

A wide variety of additional files have also been included that may be of use beyond Time-Scale Modification.

## Software Requirements
- Tested with MATLAB 2018a on Windows 10.  Everything except multi-column labels will work on earlier versions.
- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.3.1
